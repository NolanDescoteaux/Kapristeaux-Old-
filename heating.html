<h1> Heating  </h1>

<div id="solarcontent">

<p>Primary heat source consists of one high efficiency wood burning stove placed in the heart of the home adjacent to a central concrete wall that is both an architectural feature and a heat sink. See picture.</p>
<p>The stove is in the basement. The floor immediately above the stove is open, protected by a grate. Heat rises along the 22’ wall which faces the kitchen. Picture</p>
<p>Another high efficiency wood stove is located between the dining and living rooms. It is clad with natural rock which also acts as a heat sink.Picture </p>
<p>The two wood stoves primarily heat the daytime living spaces keeping the sleeping areas cooler by design. </p>
<p>Secondary heat is provided by a 5 ton geothermal unit that supports domestic water heating and hydronic in-floor heat. This unit draws heat from 5 wells drilled to 100’. It uses a refrigerant to maximise efficiency of heat extraction. REF</p>
<h3> Cooling </h3>

<p>The distribution system is divided into 11 zones controlled by their own thermostats. Rather than sensing the air temperature, the thermostats are set to maintain a specified floor slab temperature.</p>
<p>Initially we ran the thermostats to read air temperature. We found that by the time air temperature dropped sufficiently to call for heat, the slab had cooled so much that it took hours to catch up.</p>
<p>One winter we experimented with circulating water at a set temperature throughout the house. This was satisfactory but did not provide any opportunity for specific zone control. </p>

<p>Some geothermal pump units are able to provide cooling. This is an additional feature that comes for a price but one advantage is the storage of heat in the ground for use in winter.</p>
<p>We didn’t go that route.</p>
<p>Although summer days in our region can be hot, nights cool rapidly and significantly. We therefore chose passive methods of cooling. </p>
<p>The house has two intersecting spines of clerestory windows. These windows are between 15’ and 20’ above the floor and can be operated with remote mechanisms. During the day, the house is kept sealed. At night the windows are opened and the house cools. The concrete wall and floor slabs provide a heat sink. </p>

<p>Note: Solar heat capture systems are becoming quite popular and were considered for this project. Our analysis revealed that our local weather patterns do not support this approach. This close to the source, the Columbia Valley is narrow, flanked by tall mountain ranges on both sides that trap fog in the winter. Inversions are a common occurrence where cold clouds seal the valley floor in the shade while the sun shines warmly at higher elevations.</p>
