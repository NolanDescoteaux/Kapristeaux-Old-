  <h3>Kapristeaux Residence is a single family residential building project with the following objectives: </h3>

  


<ul>
  
 <li>Energy efficiency</li>
<li>Low tech/maintenance</li>
<li>Contemporary appearance</li>
<li>Interior design as a reflection of natural open spaces</li>
<li>Use of local materials</li>
<li>Use of existing proven techniques</li>
<li>Reliance on local talent</li>
</ul>

<p> More than the sum of its parts, the design of an energy efficient home depends on careful consideration of the interaction of its systems. The architectural design begins with an analysis of the site and orientation relative to sun, trees, winds and views. Solar gain informs placement and properties of glazing. Heat source is selected depending on local resources. Finally, a tight envelope requires careful consideration of air quality and circulation to evenly distribute sources of air when heating. Air movement is equally important in the summer to cool the structure. </p>

<p> An energy analysis performed early in the project (REF: Full Circle) identified two most cost-effective considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tight envelope</li>
<li>High insulation value</li>
</ul>

<p>An innovative envelope system was designed specifically for this project. The vapour/air barrier was placed within the wall, creating an uninterrupted layer with almost no penetrations for utilities.</p>
<p>Type of glazing was customised for each window based on its orientation relative to the sun.</p>
<p>Heating is provided primarily by a wood stove placed centrally along a concrete wall that acts as a heat sink. Additional heat comes from a five ton geothermal heat pump and a second high efficiency stove. </p>
<p>Warm air is collected at the top of the ceilings and redistributed throughout the house by an Air Handler, coupled to a Heat Recovery Ventilator.</p>


<p>The house achieved an Energuide rating of 87 and envelope tightness was measured at 0.72 ACH @ 50kPa. </p>
